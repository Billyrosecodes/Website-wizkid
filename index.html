    <h1 class="heading">Top 5 songs</h1>
      <p>I honestly would say every single song by Coldplay is my favourite, I can't choose! "Nobody said it was easy" and I agree. Almost every song by Coldplay brings me joy and I can't say that there is one that I dislike. I tried my best picking out my favourite songs. Do enjoy.</p>

      <h3>5. Jaiye jaiye</h3>
      <p>This track makes me feel like I've had a double espresso with a side of silliness. I can't help but wiggle my hips to the beat and pretend I'm dancing like nobody's watching. The fusion of Afrobeat and Wizkid's playful energy in this song is absolutely infectious! </p>

        <h3>4. Fever</h3>
      <p>Fever is like a musical potion that turns up the heat on my mood meter. The sultry vibe combined with Wizkid's smooth vocals never fails to put a goofy grin on my face. It's the kind of song that makes you feel like you're in your own little world of romance.</p>

        <h3>Essence</h3>
      <p>Whenever I hear "Essence," I can't help but imagine myself on a beach with a goofy, carefree smile. The laid-back groove and the enchanting vocals by Wizkid and Tems create a magical atmosphere. It's like a mini-vacation for my ears! </p>

        <h3>2. Manya</h3>
      <p>Manya is like a one-way ticket to the party zone. The rhythm is so catchy that it's impossible not to move and groove to it. I enjoy cranking up the volume, letting loose, and pretending I'm a dance floor legend while listening to this track..</p>
